# Hangman
Very Very Simple Hangman Game

Instructions:
Just a simple Hangman game where you input the letter and if you're wrong, the screen will stay blank. When you guess correctly
the answer will pop up on the screen and you have to guess the entirity of the word
Press Enter when prompted to end the game

Note: 
This is a very simple program as I am a novice programmer, any input is appreciated on how I can improve the program. 
I am also studying C in college at the moment, so I would like to get better with the language so I can move onto ones like 
Python and Java etc etc.
